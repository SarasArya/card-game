Hi All,

This project was inspired by this lovely [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/quincylarson/vanilla-javascript-basics-tutorial-video-build-a-game--zkuy9lG19) I found on freecodecamp.

Being a backend developer. I was always scared of the DOM and the CSS. But I have been taking baby steps.

This is one of the many things I will be developing as part of journey to a frontend dev.

Let's keep rocking 🎸🤘🏻
